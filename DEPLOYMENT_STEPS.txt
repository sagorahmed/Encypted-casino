# Deployment Steps - Follow These Commands

## Step 1: Navigate to Contracts Folder
```bash
cd d:\Blockchain\ project\Encrypted\ casino\contracts
```

Or if that doesn't work, use quotes:
```bash
cd "d:\Blockchain project\Encrypted casino\contracts"
```

## Step 2: Install Dependencies (if not already done)
```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

This installs all required packages. It may take 2-3 minutes.

## Step 3: Compile the Smart Contract
```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

This should output something like:
```
Compiling 1 file with 0.8.19
✓ Compiled successfully
```

**✅ If you see "✓ Compiled successfully", move to Step 4**

## Step 4: Deploy to Sepolia Testnet
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploySepolia.ts --network sepolia
```

This will:
1. Deploy your contract to Sepolia
2. Show you the contract address
3. Take about 30-60 seconds

**When it finishes, you'll see something like:**
```
Deploying GameHouse contract...
✓ Contract deployed to: 0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678
Waiting for confirmations...
✓ Contract verified on Etherscan
```

**IMPORTANT: Copy the contract address (0x1234...)**

---

## Step 5: Update Frontend Configuration

Once you have the contract address from Step 4, open:
`frontend/.env.sepolia`

Update this line:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_CASINO_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x<PASTE_YOUR_ADDRESS_HERE>
```

Replace `0x<PASTE_YOUR_ADDRESS_HERE>` with the address from Step 4.

---

## Step 6: Start Frontend

Open a NEW terminal window and run:
```bash
cd "d:\Blockchain project\Encrypted casino\frontend"
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open your browser to: **http://localhost:3000**

---

## Step 7: Test in Browser

1. Click "Connect Wallet"
2. Approve MetaMask connection
3. Make sure network is "Sepolia"
4. Deposit 0.01 ETH
5. Play a game!

## Verification - Check Your Deployment

Visit this URL (replace ADDRESS with your deployed address):
```
https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x<ADDRESS>
```

You should see your contract code on Etherscan.
